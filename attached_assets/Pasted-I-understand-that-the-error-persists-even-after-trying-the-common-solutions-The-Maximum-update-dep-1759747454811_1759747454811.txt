I understand that the error persists even after trying the common solutions. The "Maximum update depth exceeded" error is notoriously tricky because it often points to a chain reaction of updates rather than a single obvious culprit. Since the previous general advice didn't resolve it, we need to dig deeper into the specific context of your "add a contact to a new group" functionality.

Let's break down where the infinite loop might still be hiding in that specific user flow. The key is to look at every piece of code that could cause a re-render or state update when a contact is added or a group is manipulated.

Here are some more advanced and specific debugging strategies, tailored to the scenario of adding contacts to groups:

1. Isolate the Problematic Code (Binary Search Debugging):

This is often the most effective approach.

Temporarily disable related logic: Comment out the code responsible for the "add contact to group" functionality piece by piece. For example, if you have a useEffect that updates groups after a contact is added, comment it out. If you have a setState in componentDidUpdate in a group list component, comment it out.
Re-enable one by one: Once the error goes away (meaning you've commented out the offending code), start re-enabling the code snippets one by one until the error reappears. This will precisely identify the line or block of code causing the loop.
2. Deep Dive into useEffect (for Functional Components):

This is where many subtle infinite loops occur.

Review all useEffect hooks in components related to contacts and groups: Look at the components involved: the one that displays the contact form, the one that displays the group list, and any parent components managing their state.
What triggers the effect? Carefully examine the dependency array ([]) of each useEffect.
Empty array []: If you have setState inside a useEffect with an empty array, it should only run once. If it's still looping, then something outside that specific useEffect is causing subsequent renders, and perhaps another useEffect (or componentDidUpdate) is then triggering an update based on the initial state.
Dependencies in array: If you have dependencies, consider if a dependency is being updated in a way that itself triggers another update, creating a cycle.
Objects/Arrays as dependencies: If you're using objects or arrays directly as dependencies (e.g., useEffect(() => {}, [myObject])), remember that JavaScript compares object references, not content. If myObject is a new object on every render (even if its content is the same), the effect will run. Use JSON.stringify (with caution for performance) or stable references (useRef, useMemo) for complex objects, or useMemo for derived objects/arrays if they are used as dependencies.
Functions as dependencies: If you're passing a function as a dependency and that function is redefined on every render, useCallback is crucial to memoize it.
3. Check Event Handlers and Callbacks (especially onClick, onChange):

Ensure you're not calling a state setter directly within an event handler definition, which would execute it immediately on render.

Problematic:

code
JavaScript

download

content_copy

expand_less
<button onClick={setSomeState(value)}>Click Me</button> // setSomeState is called on render!
Correct:

code
JavaScript

download

content_copy

expand_less
<button onClick={() => setSomeState(value)}>Click Me</button> // setSomeState is called when button is clicked
<button onClick={handleFunction}>Click Me</button> // handleFunction is called when button is clicked
4. Context API and Redux (if you're using them):

If you're using global state management, an update in one part of your context/store might trigger re-renders in many subscribed components, and if any of those components then update local state or trigger side effects that feed back into the global state, you can get a loop.

Dispatching inside effects: Are you dispatching Redux actions or updating Context values within useEffect or componentDidUpdate without proper conditional checks?
Selectors causing re-renders: If a selector in Redux creates a new object/array reference on every state change, it can cause components using that selector to re-render, potentially triggering effects. Use reselect for memoized selectors.
5. Consider Memoization (useMemo, useCallback, React.memo):

While not a direct fix for an infinite loop caused by setState, excessive re-renders can exacerbate the problem or make it harder to trace. Memoization can prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components that might then trigger their own effects or updates.

Wrap computationally expensive values in useMemo.
Wrap functions passed as props to child components in useCallback.
Wrap functional child components in React.memo.
Example Scenario for Adding Contact to Group:

Let's imagine your flow:

User fills out contact details and selects a group.
onSubmit function calls an API to add the contact.
Upon success, you setContacts (to update the contact list) and setGroups (if group data needs to reflect the new contact count or something similar).
Potential loop:

If setGroups is called, and a GroupList component has a useEffect that runs when groups changes, and that useEffect then calls an API to fetch all contacts and setContacts...
And if setContacts causes the contact form component to re-render and trigger something again... you have a loop.
Actionable Steps for You:

Share the specific code related to "adding a contact to a new group." This includes:
The component rendering the form for adding a contact.
The onSubmit handler or similar function that processes the form data.
Any useEffect hooks or componentDidUpdate/componentWillUpdate methods in that component or any parent/child components that deal with contacts or groups.
How you are managing your contacts and groups state (e.g., useState, Context, Redux).
Use React DevTools: Install the React Developer Tools extension for your browser. It's invaluable for debugging.
Profiler Tab: Use the profiler to record a session when the error occurs. It will show you which components are rendering and why. Look for components rendering excessively.
Components Tab: Select a component and inspect its state and props. You can see how values are changing.
Let's look at the actual code. That will be the most direct way to find the culprit.
