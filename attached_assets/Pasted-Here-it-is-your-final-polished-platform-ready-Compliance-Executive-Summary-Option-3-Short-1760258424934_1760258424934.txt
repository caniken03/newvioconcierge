# ✅ VioConcierge Compliance Overview (At a Glance)

At Smart AI Solutions, we know that when you trust us with your client and caller data, **security and privacy are non-negotiable**. That’s why VioConcierge is built from the ground up to meet **GDPR, industry, and enterprise-level compliance standards** — not just on paper, but in practice.

All data is **hosted exclusively in the UK**, protected by **enterprise-grade security**, and fully controlled by **you as the Data Controller**. We only process data to deliver the service you’ve chosen, and you can access, export, or delete it at any time.

We go far beyond “basic compliance” by combining **privacy by design, strict access control, full audit transparency, optional call recording, secure retention and deletion, incident response, and business continuity**. The result is a platform that is **safe, transparent, and trusted — even by highly regulated sectors like healthcare and finance.**

**In short: VioConcierge is built to protect your data, respect your privacy, and earn your trust — every step of the way.**
